# Deepest Descent ver. 1.0.0 for macOS

## About the Game
Game design was inspired by limitations (both graphical and technical) of early personal computers. This is achieved by few selling points:
* Game is played in system Terminal (Console) only
* Maze is redrawn as a new output after each turn, giving you a chance to scroll through the history of maze states
* Art style is simplistic and was heavily inspired by Dwarfs Fortress aesthetics
* Player is able to type in a sequence of moves that will be executed one-by-one
* Completely chaotic level generation. It has so few content and enemy constraints that you can encounter truly idiotic mazes
* Local leaderboard. Compete against your friends and family and hope that luck will be on your side
* 7 enemies with different movement patterns and super powers to encounter, defeat or elude
